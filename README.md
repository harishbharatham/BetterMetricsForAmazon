# BetterMetricsForAmazon
Created a detailed documentation on how amazon should handle metrics. Proposed advanced and enhanced metrics to amazon using the amazon's public dataset. Only a few categories of dataset were considered for the analysis using mongoDB and Neo4j.
The PDF consists of the mongoDB and Neo4j queries as a proven reason why the metrics were proposed. The outputs of these queries are also provided in the PDF.
